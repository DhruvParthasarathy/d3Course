# d3Course

I purchased a course from Udemy titled "Building Data Visualizations using D3.js and Firebase" and this repo contains code related to that course.

I have extensively commented the code, and anyone who wishes to learn basic charts from d3 - like the bar chart,or the pie chart can refer to the code base to understand the basics.

Feel free to reach out to me if anything is unclear, would be happy to explain
